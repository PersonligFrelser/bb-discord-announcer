Currently only "knowable" support for NTNU (Uses an [older blackboard version](https://innsida.ntnu.no/c/wiki/get_page_attachment?p_l_id=22780&nodeId=24647&title=Blackboard+-+Bruk+av+sandkasse&fileName=1_1_finne_frem.jpg) from 2017).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. We also have a discord server to chat regarding development, help setting up the bot or general discussion, see this [link](https://discord.gg/a2sZxHR).

### Prerequisites

You need Java 11 and maven to be able to contribute to the project.

### Setup Discord Bot

For development purposes, you can use the bot on our discord server, but if you want to setup your own bot you can follow this [guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html). You need the discord bot token as well as the discord channel id in the next section.

### Application Configuration

For the time being, we have an app.properties file that holds the needed values for the bot to work. A template of the file is shown below.
This file should **NEVER be pushed to the repository or shared** with anyone as it holds private information. only have this locally.
```yaml
### NTNU BlackBoard credentials ###

# How many minutes to wait to check for new announcements

### Bot ###
